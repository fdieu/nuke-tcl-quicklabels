Here are some handy TCL quick label expression commands that I've expanded on over the past couple years.  They're great for quick glance referencing meta-data from the file location, format, resolution, localization policy, color space and frame range of a Read or Postage Stamp node's connected input.

Simply copy and paste these TCL script commands into your Read/Postage Stamp 'Node -> label' tab and refresh if necessary.
